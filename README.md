### Installation: ###
   **1. Clone this repository to your computer:**
   ```
   https://github.com/TDMVu18/Manage_Flask/tree/main
   ```
   And open folder with code editor.
   
   **2. Open Terminal, move to Project's folder:**
   
   ```
   cd Manage_Flask
   ```
   **3. Set up your Virtual Environment:**
      
Python virtual environments give you the ability to isolate your Python development projects from your system installed Python and other Python environments. This gives you full control of your project and makes it easily reproducible
   ```
   virtualenv venv
   ```
   If you haven't installed virtualenv, try:
   ```
   pip install virtualenv
   ```
   After creating virtual environment, the next thing to do is activate it:
   ```
   .\Scripts\activate
   ```
   **4. Install denpendencie**
      
Once we have the environment set up, we need to install the packages that the app requires in order to work.
Here I used *pip freeze* to pack all the packages into ***requirement.txt*** so all that was needed was to run the following code
   ```
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```
